# Mad Libs Generator

A simple Python program that generates a Mad Libs story based on user input.

## How it works

1. The program prompts the user to enter specific types if words (e.g., adjectives, nouns, verbs).
2. It then inserts these words into a pre-written story template.
3. Finally, it displays the completed story.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
   Run the script using Python:
   `bash
    python mad-libs.py`
